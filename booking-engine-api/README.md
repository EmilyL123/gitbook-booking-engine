# Booking Engine API

The __Mews Booking Engine API__ is a web API that allows external applications such as booking widgets to interact programmatically with Mews to get information about offered rooms or spaces for a given property, to check availability of those rooms or spaces, and to create reservations.
Use this option if you want to create your own custom booking engine.
