# Guidelines

This section provides guidelines and general information on how to use the __Mews Booking Engine API__. For information about individual endpoints or operations, see [API Operations](../operations/README.md).

> **Important:** The Mews Booking Engine API is designed to be consumed directly by front-end clients. It is unsuitable for continuous polling by a single server due to its built-in anti-scraping protection and such requests can fail. For server to server communication, please refer to the [Mews Connector API](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/).
