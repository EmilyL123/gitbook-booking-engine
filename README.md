# Introduction

Mews Distributor is a booking engine which enables guests to create reservations in a property using the MEWS Commander PMS. The provided options are either:

* a redirect to a standalone page hosted directly by Mews,
* or a JavaScript Widget which can be embedded into an arbitrary website

If you encounter any issue, feel free to report it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/MewsSystems/developers). For other types of requests, please contact [integrations@mewssystems.com](mailto://integrations@mewssystems.com).

## Standalone <a id="standalone"></a>

If you’re not sure which version to use, go with the standalone option. It’s the simplest way how to connect your website with the booking engine. We will provide you with a link to page where your Distributor instance is located. For further information, see [Standalone Distributor](distributor-standalone.md) or contact our support team at support@mewssystems.com.

## Widget <a id="widget"></a>

If you are a developer, you might be interested in a more advanced way how to integrate Distributor into your website. For more seamless experience, the Distributor JavaScript widget allows guests to book directly from the website of your hotel without being redirected elsewhere. For more information, consult the [Distributor Widget](distributor-widget/).

## API <a id="api"></a>

In case you’d like to implement your own custom booking engine that would be connected with MEWS, you should have a look at [Distributor API](distributor-api-v1/). Please contact [sales@mewssystems.com](mailto://sales@mewssystems.com) to activate this function.
