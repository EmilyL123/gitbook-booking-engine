* Start on the **Dashboard** (the main screen).
* In the left-hand menu, select **Settings** -> **Services**.
* In the section **Bookable services**, select the service which has the Booking Engine configuration. If there's just one service, select that one.
* On the left, select **Booking engines**.
* Select the configuration you want to use.
* In the upper section there is a field **Identifier**. This is your Configuration ID. It has the format `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`.
