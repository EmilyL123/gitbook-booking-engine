# Ways to integrate

You can integrate with the Mews Booking Engine in one of three ways.

## Standalone

If you’re not sure which integration method to use, go with the standalone option. It’s the simplest way to connect your website with the Mews Booking Engine and enable your guests to make direct bookings.
We will provide you with a link to a page where your Booking Engine instance is located. For more information, see [Booking Engine Standalone](../booking-engine-standalone/README.md) or contact our support team at [support@mews.com](mailto:support@mews.com).

## Widget

If you're a developer, you might be interested in a more advanced way to integrate the Mews Booking Engine into your website. For a more seamless experience, the Booking Engine JavaScript Widget allows guests to book directly from the website of your property without being redirected elsewhere.
For more information, see [Booking Engine Widget](../booking-engine-widget/README.md).

## API

If you would like to implement your own custom booking engine that connects directly with __Mews Operations__, have a look at the [Booking Engine API](../booking-engine-api/README.md).
Note that this option is only available to customers with an Enterprise subscription. Should you be on a different subscription and are interested in this function, please contact [customersuccess@mews.com](mailto:customersuccess@mews.com).
