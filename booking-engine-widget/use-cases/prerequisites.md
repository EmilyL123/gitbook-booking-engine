# Prerequisites for use cases

## Getting started
* You have followed the [Getting started](../getting-started.md) guide and understand how the Booking Engine Widget is installed

## Javascript and HTML
* You have some familiarity with JavaScript and HTML

## HTTPS
* The code is served from a secure location over HTTPS. If you serve it from an insecure HTTP site, you will be redirected to the [Booking Engine Standalone](../../booking-engine-standalone/README.md) and the code will not work. For testing and experimenting, you can also use services such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

## Modern browser
* You are using a modern browser, ideally the [latest Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser](https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAxIENocm9tZSB2ZXJzaW9uLCBsYXN0IDEgRmlyZWZveCB2ZXJzaW9u). The Mews Booking Engine works in other browsers and older browsers, but custom code of the use cases is not guaranteed to work in these. You can of course modify the code to make it work.
